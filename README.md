Here I have showcased my Internship Work as part of Virtual Internship 2023 (Oct-Nov 2023 Batch) at [BHARAT INTERN](https://bharatintern.live/). 

In this repository, I present my two new acconplishments during my time working at this internship programme:

## Task 1: House Price Prediction
#### Task Description:
> *Build a housing price prediction model that can overcome the strong multicollinearity that this dataset holds and predict the sales with respect to a single or multiple features as selected by the user (input received from user) along with the functionality of generating R2, RMSE scores of the model's operation.*

## Task 2: IRIS Flower Classification
#### Task Description:
> *Build an IRIS flower classification model that can learn the details of each flower in the dataset and which species it belongs to, then predict the species of a flower using the length and width of their petals and sepals using values input by the user.*

I'm excited to share the outcomes of all my tasks, and I encourage you to explore the respective project work in detail using the corresponding folders above containing both the source code and .ipynb python notebooks which is my final form of work that I intend to submit.

Feel free to reach me out if you have any questions or feedback.
Sincerely Thanks for reviewing my internship work!
